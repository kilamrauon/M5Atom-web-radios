# M5Atom-web-radios
A web radio for M5Atom, switch between radios with button

I mixed two arduino radio web sketches to make this one.
(the m5stick radio sketche and the sketche webradio for esp3866 and esp32)
The out pin for the sound is G22

It allows to use the M5atom as a wab radio and switch between different urls with the only button.

You can watch the radio here : https://youtu.be/mannr5FVdJ0

I tried this on M5Atom Matrix but I guess it will work on the other M5Atom.

The list of radios is restrictive because it's hard to find urls' radios that won't stutter.
